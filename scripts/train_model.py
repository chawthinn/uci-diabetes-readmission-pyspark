"""
This script trains a readmission prediction model for diabetic patients.
It loads a preprocessed, one-hotâ€“encoded dataset (originally prepared using a PySpark pipeline),
then trains a Random Forest classifier using scikit-learn.

The model and its corresponding feature list are saved as `.pkl` and `.json` files, respectively,
to support deployment in a Streamlit web application. Scikit-learn was chosen for its ease of
integration with Python-based app frameworks, allowing efficient inference without requiring
a Spark environment.

Outputs:
- rf_sklearn_model.pkl : Trained model for prediction
- feature_names.json   : Ordered list of feature names to ensure input alignment

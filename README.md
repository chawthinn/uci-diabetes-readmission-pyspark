# uci-diabetes-readmission-pyspark	
This repository is for a group project as part of the Big Data Framework course. It focuses on building a predictive machine learning model using PySpark on the UCI "Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999â€“2008" dataset. The goal is to predict patient readmission by performing data preprocessing, transformation, feature engineering, and model training using scalable Spark ML techniques.
